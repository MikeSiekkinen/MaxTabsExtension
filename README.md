This chrome extension does one simple thing: limit the maximum number of unpinned tabs that can be open at once.  

When ever a new tab is opened the oldest unpinned tab will be automatically closed without prompting confirmation. 
A notification window displaying the title and url will be displayed briefly on the currently active tab.

You can configure the maximum number of allowed tabs in the Options.
