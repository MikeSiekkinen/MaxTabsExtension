This chrome extension does one simple thing: limit the maximum number of unpinned tabs that can be open at once.  

When ever a new tab is opened the oldest unpinned tab will be automatically closed without prompting confirmation. 
A notification window displaying the title and url will be displayed briefly on the currently active tab.

You can configure the maximum number of allowed tabs in the Options.

Motivation

This is a simple feature I hadn't seen in any tab managers I've come across. 
While I'm sure I've just missed it and this exists elsewhere I also was using this
as an exercise in coding something primarily with ChatGPT driving.

The icon was generated with MidJourney.
